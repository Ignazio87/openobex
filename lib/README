This is the openobex c-library. I have compiled it on Linux, Solaris
and Win2K. Maybe it compiles on other platforms to.

To compile for Unix do the normal ./confgure, make, make install.
To compile for Win2k read README.win32.

Platform differences:

Linux:
IrDA, TCP/IP and async operation works.

Solaris:
Only TCP/IP works.

win32:
IrDA and TCP/IP works.
