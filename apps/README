This is the apps that comes with the Open OBEX c-library. These are not meant
to be more than test-programs to look at if you want to see how use the
library itself.

To build them you need to first compile and _install_ the library.
Then you do the usual:
# ./configure --prefix=<where you want>
# make
# make install


To build on win32 you need to edit makefile.msc.rules.
To compile using VC6:

# copy config.h.win32 config.h
# nmake -f makefile.msc
